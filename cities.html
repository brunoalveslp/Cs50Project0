      <h2>Vancouver</h2>
      <img src="project0/img/Vancouver.jpg">
      The beautiful natural surroundings around the city make Vancouver one of the top tourist destinations and one of the best cities in the world to live.

Vancouver is located by the sea, surrounded by snowy mountains and greenery. The city has a climate that tends to please Brazilians: in winter, the thermometer rarely drops below zero degrees. In summer the average temperature is 20 degrees, but there are periods when it gets over 30 degrees. The beautiful natural landscape around the city, the many parks, the beaches, as well as other places of recreation, make Vancouver the third largest city in the country, one of the main tourist destinations and one of the best cities in the world to live.

From a region inhabited by indigenous peoples, with dense forests and mountainous coastline to one of Canada's largest cultural and commercial centers, the city of Vancouver has maintained its natural beauty while adapting to constant development. In less than a century, Vancouver has become the main industrial, commercial and financial center of the West Coast of Canada. The location was also North America's first port on the Pacific Ocean; this became the western port with the most links with Asia, attracting immigrants of the most different nationalities.
Attractions

Among its attractions is the historic district of Gastown, which houses restaurants, shops, cafes and the former headquarters of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Whoever wants to shop, the indicated place is Robson Street, where there are also bars, restaurants, bookstores, cafes and, of course, many stores. To get to know the city better, it's worth taking a seabus tour, which takes passengers between Waterfront Station and Lonsdale Quay. A visit to the Harbor Center Tower and Chinatown, the Chinese quarter, which is older than the city, is also recommended. The neighborhood, which was born with the arrival of Chinese immigrants in search of gold, was listed in 1970 as a historic area.

The city of Vancouver, considered in 2001 by the UN as the best city in the world in terms of quality of life, is among the most beautiful in the country: Victorian residences and modern skyscrapers contrast with its wonderful nature.
